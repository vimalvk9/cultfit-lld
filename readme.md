Design a system to manage Fitness classes across the country.

Use cases:
Register a user
Login user
Check availability of classes
Book a class
Check userâ€™s own schedule for given timeframe

Assumptions:
Only valid users can login.
Users can not book multiple classes that overlap timings.
Classes can be booked only if seats are available.
Back-End database is not needed. In memory data structures like List, Queue, Map etc can be used for the purpose of that.
