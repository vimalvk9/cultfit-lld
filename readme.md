Design a system to manage Fitness classes across the country.

Use cases:
1. Register a user
2. Login user
3. Check availability of classes
4. Book a class
5. Check userâ€™s own schedule for given timeframe

Assumptions:
1. Only valid users can login.
2. Users can not book multiple classes that overlap timings.
3. Classes can be booked only if seats are available.
4. Back-End database is not needed. In memory data structures like List, Queue, Map etc can be used for the purpose of that.
